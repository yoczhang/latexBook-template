\section{Writing Sample}

We will define the integral of a measurable function in three steps. First, we define the integral of a nonnegative simple function. Let $E$ be the measurable set in $\mathcal{R}^N$.

\begin{definition}{Left Coset}{}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group~$G$.  A \emph{left coset} of $H$ in $G$ is a subset of $G$ that is of the form $xH$, where $x \in G$ and $xH = \{ xh : h \in H \}$. Similarly a \emph{right coset} of $H$ in $G$ is a subset of $G$ that is of the form $Hx$, where $Hx = \{ hx : h \in H \}$ $\hbar$
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
Note that a subgroup~$H$ of a group $G$ is itself a left coset of $H$ in $G$.
\end{note}

\begin{theorem}{Lagrange's Theorem}{}
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.  Then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}{Size of Left Coset}{}
Let $H$ be a finite subgroup of a group $G$.  Then each left coset of $H$ in $G$ has the same number of elements as $H$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $z$ be some element of $xH \cap yH$.  Then $z = xa$ for some $a \in H$, and $z = yb$ for some $b \in H$. If $h$ is any element of $H$ then $ah \in H$ and $a^{-1}h \in H$, since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. But $zh = x(ah)$ and $xh = z(a^{-1}h)$ for all $h \in H$. Therefore $zH \subset xH$ and $xH \subset zH$, and thus $xH = zH$.  Similarly $yH = zH$, and thus $xH = yH$, as required. 
\end{proof}

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. While there are many types of regression analysis, at their core they all examine the influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable. The process of performing a regression allows you to confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, and how these factors influence each other.

Let's continue using our application training example. In this case, we'd want to measure the historical levels of satisfaction with the events from the past three years or so, as well as any information possible in regards to the independent variables.
