\chapter{FAQ}
We list some FAQs for users to refer to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \question{Why option numbers for natbib fail to take effect in v3.07?}
  In v3.07, when \lstinline{gbt7714} is introduced, option \lstinline{authoryear} is incompatible with \lstinline{natbib}. In v3.08 and 3.09, \lstinline{numbers}, \lstinline{numbers}, \lstinline{super} and \lstinline{authoryear} are introduced.
  \item \question{I want to customize font and background color.}
  Please use \lstinline{pagecolor} to change background color, refer to \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/278544/xcolor-what-is-the-equivalent-of-default-text-color}{this} to customize font.
  \item \question{Which version should I choose?}
  Please use \href{https://github.com/ElegantLaTeX/ElegantBook/releases}{Latest Release} via GitHub or \TeX{} Live 2019.
  \item \question{Which editor should I choose?}
  You can use \TeX{} Live 2019 built-in \TeX works or \TeX Studio. You may refer to \href{https://github.com/EthanDeng/texworks-autocomplete}{\TeX{}works autocomplete}. \TeX{} Live 2019 + \TeX{}studio is strongly recommended. I myself use VS Code and Sublime Text. Related configurations can be found at \href{https://github.com/EthanDeng/vscode-latex}{vscode-latex} and \href{https://github.com/EthanDeng/sublime-text-latex}{sublime-text-latex}.
